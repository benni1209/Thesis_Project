# Statistical Matching using a Non-Probability Sample as Auxiliary Dataset

This repository contains all implementation and analysis scripts used in the thesis project.

## Repository Structure

### Estimation Methods
These files contain the implementation of the 4 estimation methods (two calibration approaches and two variants of the EM algorithm)

- **`Calibration_Methods.Rmd`**: univariate calibration (X) and full calibration using IPF
- **`EM_Algorithm.Rmd`**: Expectation-Maximization algorithm for multinomial data

Each of the three analyses (MAR, MNAR, Y-Z Association) contain separate scripts for implementation and analysis for clarity and reproducibility.

### Implementation Scripts
These files conduct the monte carlo simulation (1,000 replications): Generating the data, defining the scenarios (selection mechanisms), applying the estimation methods to estimate the joint distributionn across the scenarios.

- **`MAR_Implementation.Rmd`**: Implementation of Missing At Random mechanisms with multiple selection patterns (linear decrease, U-shaped, step function, extreme increase)
- **`MNAR_Implementation.Rmd`**: Implementation of Missing Not At Random mechanisms (main effects and interaction effects between Y and Z)
- **`YZ-Association_Implementation.Rmd`**: Implementation of various association strenghts between Y and Z with different selection mechanisms

### Analysis Scripts
These files load the monte carlo simulation results generated by the implementation scripts to analysis and evaluate method performances:

- **`MAR_Analysis.Rmd`**: Analysis of method performance under MAR scenarios
- **`MNAR_Analysis.Rmd`**: Analysis of method performance under MNAR scenarios  
- **`YZ-Association_Analysis.Rmd`**: Analysis examining how the strength of Y-Z association affects method performance

### Additional Scripts

- **`Association_Measure_Cramer_s_V_.Rmd`**: Implementation of Cramér's V as a measure of association strength between the variables in the population
- **`Quantifying_Interaction.Rmd`**: Quantification of interaction effects in the MNAR selection mechanisms

## Methodology

### Data Generation
The implementation creates synthetic populations with:
- **Variable X**: Categorical auxiliary variable (6 categories)
- **Variables Y and Z**: Outcome variables of interest (3 categories each)

Three samples are drawn from the population:
- **Sample A**: Contains variables X and Y
- **Sample B**: Contains variables X and Z  
- **Sample C**: Contains all three variables (X, Y, Z) but with selection bias

### Selection Mechanisms

#### MAR (Missing At Random)
Selection into Sample C depends on the background variable X:
- Linear decreasing patterns (moderate, baseline & extreme)
- U-shaped selection patterns
- Step function patterns
- Extreme bias scenarios

#### MNAR (Missing Not At Random)  
Selection into Sample C depends on the target variables Y and Z:
- Pure main effects: classic increase, non-monotonic, y-only
- Interaction Effects: weak, moderate, strong, extreme

### Statistical Methods

The following estimation approaches are evaluated:

1. **Raw Sample C**: Unadjusted biased sample
2. **X-Calibration**: Calibrated to population X distribution
3. **Full Calibration**: Calibrated to X, (X,Y) from Sample A, and (X,Z) from Sample B using IPF
4. **EM Algorithm (Raw)**: Applied to the (unadjusted) raw Sample C
5. **EM Algorithm (Calibrated X)**: Applied to X-calibrated Sample C

### Performance Metrics

Methods are evaluated using:
- **Total Absolute Difference (TAD)**: Sum of absolute cell-wise errors
- **Single Worst Cell (SWC) Absolute**: Worst-case cell error
- **Single Worst Cell (SWC) Signed**: Signed error for the most problematic cell

## Requirements

### R Version
- R 4.0.0 or higher recommended

### Required R Packages
```r
# Data manipulation and visualization
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
library(reshape2)

# Table formatting
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Sampling
library(sampling)
```

## Usage

### Running Implementation Scripts

1. **Generate data with MAR mechanism:**
```r
rmarkdown::render("MAR_Implementation.Rmd")
```

2. **Generate data with MNAR mechanism:**
```r
rmarkdown::render("MNAR_Implementation.Rmd")
```

3. **Generate data for Y-Z association:**
```r
rmarkdown::render("YZ-Association_Implementation.Rmd")
```

### Running Analysis Scripts

The implementation scripts generate monte carlo simulation results saved as RDS files:
- `bootstrap_results_MAR_scenarios(1000).rds`
- `bootstrap_results_MNAR_scenarios(1000).rds`  
- `bootstrap_results_association_mar_mnar_(1000).rds`

The saved RDF files can be used to run the analysis scripts:
Run the analysis:
```r
rmarkdown::render("MAR_Analysis.Rmd")
rmarkdown::render("MNAR_Analysis.Rmd")
rmarkdown::render("YZ-Association_Analysis.Rmd")
```

### Customization

Key parameters can be modified in the implementation scripts:
- `N_pop`: Population size (default: 1,000,000)
- `n_bootstrap`: Number of monte carlo (bootstrap) iterations (default: 1,000)
- Sample sizes for A, B, and C
- Selection mechanisms
- Association structures

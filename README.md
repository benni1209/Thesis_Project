# Statistical Matching using a Non-Probability Sample as Auxiliary Dataset

This repository contains the complete analysis code and implementation scripts that were used in the thesis project.

## Overview

This project examines methods for estimating joint distributions of two categorical variables (Y and Z) when complete observations are unavailable and data is distributed across multiple samples:
- **Sample A**: Contains variables X and Y
- **Sample B**: Contains variables X and Z  
- **Sample C**: Contains all three variables (X, Y, Z) but with potential selection bias

The research evaluates various statistical methods under both Missing At Random (MAR) and Missing Not At Random (MNAR) scenarios, using bootstrap simulations with 1,000 iterations per scenario.


## Repository Structure

### Estimation Methods
These files contain the implementation of the 4 estiamtion methods (two calibration approaches and two variants of the EM algorithm)

- **`Calibration_Methods.Rmd`**: Two calibration procedures (univariate calibration (X) and full calibration using Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF))
- **`EM_Algorithm.Rmd`**: Expectation-Maximization algorithm for multinomial data

Each of the three analyses (MAR, MNAR, Y-Z Association) contain separate scripts for implementation and analysis for clarity and reproducibility.

### Implementation Scripts
These files conduct the monte carlo simulation (1,000 replications per scenario): Generating the data, defining the scenarios (selection mechanisms), applying the estimation methods to estimate the joint distributionn across the scenarios.

- **`MAR_Implementation.Rmd`**: Implementation of Missing At Random mechanisms with multiple selection patterns (linear decrease, U-shaped, step function, extreme increase)
- **`MNAR_Implementation.Rmd`**: Implementation of Missing Not At Random mechanisms (main effects and interaction effects between Y and Z)
- **`YZ-Association_Implementation.Rmd`**: Implementation of various association strenghts between Y and Z with different selection mechanisms

### Analysis Scripts
These files load the monte carlo simulation results generated by the implementation scripts to analysis and evaluate method performances:

- **`MAR_Analysis.Rmd`**: Analysis of method performance under MAR scenarios
- **`MNAR_Analysis.Rmd`**: Analysis of method performance under MNAR scenarios  
- **`YZ-Association_Analysis.Rmd`**: Analysis examining how the strength of Y-Z association affects method performance

### Additional Scripts

- **`Association_Measure_Cramer_s_V_.Rmd`**: Implementation of Cramér's V as a measure of association strength between the variables in the population
- **`Quantifying_Interaction.Rmd`**: Quantification of interaction effects in the MNAR selection mechanisms

## Methodology

### Data Generation
The implementation creates synthetic populations with:
- **Variable X**: Categorical auxiliary variable (6 categories)
- **Variables Y and Z**: Outcome variables of interest (3 categories each)
- Controllable association structures between all variable pairs

### Missing Data Mechanisms

#### MAR (Missing At Random)
Selection into Sample C depends on observed variables (X, Y, or Z) but not on the missing values:
- Linear decreasing patterns (moderate and extreme)
- U-shaped selection patterns
- Step function patterns
- Extreme bias scenarios

#### MNAR (Missing Not At Random)  
Selection into Sample C depends on both Y and Z simultaneously, including interaction effects:
- Pure main effects (classic, non-monotonic, Y-only)
- Weak, moderate, and strong interaction effects
- Extreme interaction scenarios

### Statistical Methods

The analysis evaluates several estimation approaches:

1. **Raw Sample C**: Unadjusted biased sample
2. **X-Calibration**: Calibrated to population X distribution
3. **Full Calibration**: Calibrated to X, (X,Y), and (X,Z) using IPF
4. **EM Algorithm**: Applied to raw and X-calibrated Sample C

### Performance Metrics

Methods are evaluated using:
- **Total Absolute Difference (TAD)**: Sum of absolute cell-wise errors
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Overall distribution accuracy
- **Maximum Absolute Error**: Worst-case cell error
- **Cramér's V**: Association strength in estimated distributions
- **Worst Cell Bias**: Signed error for the most problematic cell

## Requirements

### R Version
- R 4.0.0 or higher recommended

### Required R Packages
```r
# Data manipulation and visualization
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
library(reshape2)

# Table formatting
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Sampling
library(sampling)
```

## Usage

### Running Implementation Scripts

1. **Generate data with MAR mechanism:**
```r
rmarkdown::render("MAR_Implementation.Rmd")
```

2. **Generate data with MNAR mechanism:**
```r
rmarkdown::render("MNAR_Implementation.Rmd")
```

3. **Apply calibration methods:**
```r
rmarkdown::render("Calibration_Methods.Rmd")
```

4. **Run EM algorithm:**
```r
rmarkdown::render("EM_Algorithm.Rmd")
```

### Running Analysis Scripts

The analysis scripts expect bootstrap results saved as RDS files:
- `bootstrap_results_MAR_scenarios(1000).rds`
- `bootstrap_results_MNAR_scenarios(1000).rds`  
- `bootstrap_results_association_mar_mnar_(1000).rds`

Run the analysis:
```r
rmarkdown::render("MAR_Analysis.Rmd")
rmarkdown::render("MNAR_Analysis.Rmd")
rmarkdown::render("YZ-Association_Analysis.Rmd")
```

### Customization

Key parameters can be modified in the implementation scripts:
- `N_pop`: Population size (default: 1,000,000)
- `n_bootstrap`: Number of bootstrap iterations (default: 1,000)
- `base_prob`: Base selection probability for Sample C
- Sample sizes for A, B, and C
- Selection probability patterns
- Association structures
